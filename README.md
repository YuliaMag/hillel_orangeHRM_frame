PyTest Framework Example
This repository contains a sample test framework using pytest for testing Python applications.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download it from python.org.

Installing
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pytest-framework-example.git
cd pytest-framework-example
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Tests
To run all tests, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
pytest
To run a specific test file, use:

bash
Copy code
pytest path/to/test_file.py
Writing Tests
All test files should be placed in the tests directory. Here's an example of how a simple test file (test_example.py) might look:

python
Copy code
# test_example.py

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def test_addition():
    assert add(3, 4) == 7
    assert add(1, 2) == 3

def test_addition_negative():
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0
    assert add(-5, -5) == -10
Running Tests with Coverage
To run tests and generate a coverage report, use:

bash
Copy code
pytest --cov=your_module_name tests/
This will show you the percentage of code that is covered by your tests.
